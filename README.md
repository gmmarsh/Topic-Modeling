# Topic-Modeling
This project utilized Gensim's Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) alogorithm. The goal of this unsupervised machine learning model is to uncover hidden patterns or structures in text data without predefined labels.

## Introduction
The project's main goal was to learn how to use the Gensim LDA model for analyzing text and uncovering topics.

A secondary goal was to create a methodology for product marketers to extract and analyze large volumes of Amazon review data using the Gensim LDA model. This methodology aims to identify hidden patterns and structures within the reviews, helping marketers gain deeper insights into consumer opinions and preferences.

To refine this methodology, the project used datasets from scikit-learn and the Miller Center API. We compared the results across these datasets to practice and improve our text data preprocessing techniques.

## Data
The dataset used for each Flask application are completely different.

The amazon_reviews_gensim flask application used Amazon review data that was pulled from the Rainforest API.

The news_group_gensim flask application used scikit-learn news group dataset. It is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents partitioned across 20 different newsgroups.

The president_speeches_gensim flask application used a dataset of Presidential speeches pulled from the Miller Center API.

## Methodology

The topic modeling process involves the following steps:

1. Data Collection: Gather text data from various sources such as APIs or datasets.
2. Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the text data by removing stop words, punctuation, and performing tokenization. The SPACY package was used for this.
3. Model Training: Use the Gensim library to train a topic model using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model on the preprocessed text data.
4. Topic Extraction: Extract and interpret the topics generated by the model.
5. Visualization: Visualize the topics and their associated words to gain insights by using the pyLDAvis package.

## Results
To evaluate the results of all three Flask applications, the CoherenceModel from the Gensim library was used. The coherence score measures the degree of semantic similarity between high scoring words in the topics. A higher coherence score indicates a better quality topic model.

## Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/gmmarsh/Topic-Modeling.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the main scripts: `amazon_review_gensim_flask/app.py`, `news_group_gensim_flaks/app.py`, `president_speeches_gensim_flaks/app.py`
